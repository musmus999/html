			<h1>Html notes</h1>
			<h1>h1 is the header</h1>
			<h2>This is an h2, it is a smaller header than h1</h2>
			<h3>This is an h3</h3>
			<h4>This is an h4</h4>
			<h5>And this is a h5....</h5>
			
			<p>The p tag is for paragraph, the br tag is a line break (enter),</p>
			
			<p>The div tag makes a division of the page, the strong tag makes text <strong>bold</strong>, the em tag makes the text <em>italic</em>
			the ul tag makes a list (not in in order) of things marked by bullet points, the li tag adds to the list. Ol tag is like ul but it is numbered 
			
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>a</li>
				<li>b</li>
				<li>c</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>This is an ol</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>a</li>
				<li>b</li>
				<li>c</li>

			<p>You can add images by putting the url in an img tag followed by src="link</p>
			<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jPLJbSp6vKY/maxresdefault.jpg" />
			
			<p>You can add a video the same way you add an image except the tag is video instead of img, and that you cant simply put the url, you need the video file</p>
			
			<p>You can link other pages diguised by test by using the a tag. By putting a and putting the href inside of it you can put any text between the two tags. You will be able to click on the text and be linked to a new page.</p>

			<h1>Css</h1>
			
			<p style="color: red">Css helps you style your page. You can write css in html or in a seperate file. <br>To write it in the html file you must use what are called inline styles. They can target specific pieces of text and style them (colour,font,size). You would put <strong>style= "color: red;</strong> in between the p and the > of the opening p tag. That paragraph would now be in red.</p>
			
			<p>To apply styling to an entire page, you must put the style tags in the head tag (which contains metadata).</p>
			
			<p>Often times however, developers will seperate the css file from the html file. To link it, you must 
			put the (link href= >) tag. Put the file name after "=". You have to then put the type of file (type="text/css") and the relationship between the two files (rel="stylesheet")</p>
			
			<h1>The css file</h1>
			
			<p>You can select elements of the html file to style. If you put p{<em>blue for example</em>}, everything in every paragraph will be blue, however it will be overruled by an inline style tag. You can also class parts of your text and name them. You can call this paragraph john, then in your css file you can say john is green. this paragraph will be green. You would refer to john as such: .john{}. In the swiggly brackets you put style tags. You can put as many classes as you want in an html element. You can also select elements with a class instead of a class alone. You simply put h1.max if you want to select h1s with that are in the max class. </p>
			
			<h1>Nesting</h1>
			
			<p>You  can nest elements and tags and classes within eachother. You can select all h1s with classed max by putting (h1.max {}). However you can also select all items classed max that are h1s by putting ".max h1 {}". The combinations are endless!</p>
			
			<p>The best way to easily style elements and tags is to create a class for every different colour, font, etc and name it of the same style (.green makes the text green). Then, all you do is put the class of whichever element/tag you want to be green as green.</p>  
			
			<h1>The different properties of text styles</h1>
			
			<p>The different properties of text are "color", "font-family", "font-size", "font-allignment", "font-weight", "line-height", etc...</p>
			
			<p>You can set the background image by using the background image property. The value (instead of a number) is the url between brackets and quotations.</p>
			
		    <h1>Borders</h1>
			
			<p>Borders suround an element. To change this property you use "border:". The 3 properties of a border are width, style and colour. If you put "border: 3px solid coral;" your border will be 3px wide, solid and coral colour. You can also modify 
			</p>
			
			<p>Padding is the space between the text (content) and the border. The only property of padding is px (width). This affects all side of the text. You can specify which side you would like to modify by specifying. padiing-bottom, padding-top, padding-left, padding-right. You can put in 1 line, the four numbers in clockwise order.<br>
            padding: 6px 9px 5px 2px<br>
            If you leave out one side it will match the opposite side (top bottom, left right).</p>
			
			<p>The same ideas apply to margin. Margin is the space around the border. Nothing can enter the margin (ex: the border of another element cannot interfere with the margin). The Top and bottom margins do not combine, left and right margins combine.</p>
			
			<p>Min-width and Max-width, Min-height and Max-height control how big or small an element can become when stretched/shrunk on different screens.</p>
			
			<p>Overflow is the property that decides what happens with content that that spills out of its borders. Three options: hidden, scroll, visible. They do exactly what they say (hide, add scroll bar, show out of box).
