			<h1>Html notes</h1>
			<h1>h1 is the header</h1>
			<h2>This is an h2, it is a smaller header than h1</h2>
			<h3>This is an h3</h3>
			<h4>This is an h4</h4>
			<h5>And this is a h5....</h5>
			
			<p>The p tag is for paragraph, the br tag is a line break (enter),</p>
			
			<p>The div tag makes a division of the page, the strong tag makes text <strong>bold</strong>, the em tag makes the text <em>italic</em>
			the ul tag makes a list (not in in order) of things marked by bullet points, the li tag adds to the list. Ol tag is like ul but it is numbered 
			
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>a</li>
				<li>b</li>
				<li>c</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>This is an ol</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>a</li>
				<li>b</li>
				<li>c</li>
			</ol>
            
			<p>You can add images by putting the url in an img tag followed by src="link</p>
			<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jPLJbSp6vKY/maxresdefault.jpg" />
			
			<p>You can add a video the same way you add an image except the tag is video instead of img, and that you cant simply put the url, you need the video file</p>
			
			<p>You can link other pages by using  
			
			<h1>Css</h1>
			
			<p style="color: red">Css helps you style your page. You can write css in html or in a seperate file. <br>To write it in the html file you must use what are called inline styles. They can target specific pieces of text and style them (colour,font,size). You would put <strong>style= "color: red;</strong> in between the p and the > of the opening p tag. That paragraph would now be in red.</p>
			
			<p>To apply styling to an entire page, you must put the style tags in the head tag (which contains metadata).</p>
			
			<p>Often times however, developers will seperate the css file from the html file. To link it, you must 
			put the (link href= >) tag. Put the file name after "=". You have to then put the type of file (type="text/css") and the relationship between the two files (rel="stylesheet")</p>
			
			<h1>The css file</h1>
			
			<p>You can select elements of the html file to style. If you put p{<em>blue for example</em>}, everything in every paragraph will be blue, however it will be overruled by an inline style tag. You can also class parts of your text and name them. You can call this paragraph john, then in your css file you can say john is green. this paragraph will be green. </p>
